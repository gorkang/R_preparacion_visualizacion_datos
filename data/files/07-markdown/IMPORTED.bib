The nature of this training effect remains unclear. Does training help participants correct erroneous stereotypical intuitions through deliberation? Or does it help them develop correct intuitions? We addressed this issue in four studies with base-rate neglect and conjunction fallacy problems. We used a two-response paradigm in which participants first gave an initial intuitive response, under time pressure and cognitive load, and then gave a final response after deliberation. Studies 1A and 2A showed that training boosted performance and did so as early as the intuitive stage. After training, most participants solved the problems correctly from the outset and no longer needed to correct an initial incorrect answer through deliberation. Studies 1B and 2B indicated that this sound intuiting persisted over at least two months. The findings confirm that a short training can debias reasoning at an intuitive ``System 1'' stage and get reasoners to favour logical over stereotypical intuitions.},

This study aimed to determine how and how often GLMMs are used in psychology and to summarize how the information about them is presented in published articles. Our focus in this respect was mainly on frequentist models. In order to review studies applying GLMMs in psychology we searched the Web of Science for articles published over the period 2014\textendash 2018. A total of 316 empirical articles were selected for trend study from 2014 to 2018. We then conducted a systematic review of 118 GLMM analyses from 80 empirical articles indexed in Journal Citation Reports during 2018 in order to evaluate report quality. Results showed that the use of GLMMs increased over time and that 86.4\% of articles were published in first- or second-quartile journals. Although GLMMs have, in recent years, been increasingly used in psychology, most of the important information about them was not stated in the majority of articles. Report quality needs to be improved in line with current recommendations for the use of GLMMs.},

In this article, the authors discuss and explain, through derivation of equations and empirical examples, that mean-centering changes lower order regression coefficients but not the highest order coefficients, does not change the fit of regression models, does not impact the power to detect moderating effects, and does not alter the reliability of product terms. The authors outline the positive effects of mean-centering, namely, the increased interpretability of the results and its importance for moderator analysis in structural equations and multilevel analysis. It is recommended that researchers center their predictor variables when their variables do not have meaningful zero-points within the range of the variables to assist in interpreting the results.},

We test the common caricature of realism that justice is ``what the judge ate for breakfast'' in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges' two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct ``decision sessions.'' We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from {$\approx$}65\% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to {$\approx$}65\% after a break. Our findings suggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.},

In this paper, we describe an approach that substantially reduces the time required to test behavioral experiments: automated simulation of participant behavior. We describe how software that is used to build experiments can use information contained in the experiment's code to automatically generate plausible participant behavior. We demonstrate this through an implementation using jsPsych. We then describe four potential scenarios where automated simulation of participant behavior can improve the way researchers build experiments. Each scenario includes a demo and accompanying code.

  abstract = {Lived experience suggests substantial heterogeneity in how people react to a common stimuli. Previous work has considered several potential sources of bias and confusion in studying interactions but relatively less attention has been devoted to the nature of the outcome variable in such studies. Here, we consider power and false discovery associated with estimates of interaction parameters as a function of the distributional and metric properties of the outcome. Focusing on a variety of models for non-continuously distributed outcomes (binary, count, and ordinal outcomes), we show that power analyses need to carefully attend to specific details of a given situation and that attempts to use the linear model for recovery can be catastrophic in some settings. Focusing on transformations of normally distributed variables (i.e., censoring and departures from interval scaling) we show that linear models produce spurious interaction effects when such effects are absent from the generating model. We also provide illustrations offering geometric intuition as to why interactions can be a challenge for these incorrectly specified linear models. In light of these findings, we make two specific suggestions. First, a careful consideration of the distributional properties of the outcome variable should be a standard component in interaction studies. Second, hand-tailored power calculations should be provided; to that end, we have written software to help researchers scrutinize their ability to study interactions in given data contexts.},

In the words of Cook and Campbell (1976; see also Shadish, Cook, \& Campbell, 2002), ``Statistical Conclusions Validity'' threatens all research subjected to the dark arts of statistical magic. Although traditional statistics classes may advise against certain practices (e.g., multiple comparisons, small sample sizes, violating normality), they may fail to cover others (e.g., outlier detection and violating linearity). More common, perhaps, is that researchers may fail to remember them. In this paper, rather than rehashing old warnings and diatribes against this practice or that, I instead advocate a general statistical analysis strategy. This graphically-based eight step strategy promises to resolve the majority of statistical traps researchers may fall in without having to remember large lists of problematic statistical practices. These steps will assist in preventing both false positives and negatives and yield critical insights about the data that would have otherwise been missed. I conclude with an applied example that shows how the eight steps reveal interesting insights that would not be detected with standard statistical practices.},

Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

For decades, there have been calls for better theories and the adoption of a strong inference approach to science. However, there is little reason to believe that psychological science is ready to change. Although recent developments like the open science movement have improved transparency and replicability, they have not addressed psychological science's method-oriented (rather than problem-oriented) mindset. Psychological science still does not embrace the scientific method of developing theories, conducting critical tests of those theories, detecting contradictory results, and revising (or disposing of) the theories accordingly.

Using these data as our departure point, we present a set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of LMMs. It is the authors' intention that the paper supports a step-change in the reporting of LMMs across the psychological sciences, preventing a trajectory in which findings reported today cannot be transparently understood and used tomorrow.},

Also, the paper presents a bifactor analysis carried out to determine whether CR is a related but independent factor or a second-stratum factor in a hier\- archical model of cognitive intelligence. Finally, the study also tested a path meta-analytic model of the CRcognitive ability relationships. The results showed that CR correlated substantially with all the cognitive abili\- ties and skills (K ranged from 3 to 44 and N ranged from 624 to 20,307). The bifactor analysis showed that CR variance was mainly accounted for by a general factor of cognitive intelligence plus a second-stratum factor of numerical ability. The results of the bifactor analysis were similar for numerical-CRT and verbal-CRT. It was not found evidence supporting the existence of a cognitive reflection factor. Finally, the path meta-analytic model showed that the combination of cognitive intelligence and numerical ability accounted for 69\% of CR variance. The path model showed that cognitive intelligence and numerical ability have direct and indirect (through numeracy skills) effects on CR. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and future research is suggested.},

The impact of these efforts is not known. The present observational meta-research study examined how often scientists in different fields use various graph types, and assessed whether visualization practices have changed between 2010 and 2020. We developed and validated an automated screening tool, designed to identify bar graphs of counts or proportions, bar graphs of continuous data, bar graphs with dot plots, dot plots, box plots, violin plots, histograms, pie charts, and flow charts. Papers from 23 fields (approximately 1000 papers/field per year) were randomly selected from PubMed Central and screened (n=227998). F1 scores for different graphs ranged between 0.83 and 0.95 in the internal validation set. While the tool also performed well in external validation sets, F1 scores were lower for uncommon graphs. Bar graphs are more often used incorrectly to display continuous data than they are used correctly to display counts or proportions. The proportion of papers that use bar graphs of continuous data varies markedly across fields (range in 2020: 4\textendash 58\%), with high rates in biochemistry and cell biology, complementary and alternative medicine, physiology, genetics, oncology and carcinogenesis, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology. Visualization practices have improved in some fields in recent years. Fewer than 25\% of papers use flow charts, which provide information about attrition and the risk of bias. The present study highlights the need for continued interventions to improve visualization and identifies fields that would benefit most.},

  abstract = {Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be ``tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary `omnibus' F test'' (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-tests. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

The challenge is to communicate the inherent scientific uncertainty \textemdash especially about the underlying quality of the evidence \textemdash{} whilst supporting informed decision making. Little is known about the effects that such scientific uncertainty has on people's judgments of the information. In three experimental studies (total N=6,489), we investigate the influence of scientific uncertainty about the quality of the evidence on people's perceived trustworthiness of the information and decision making. We compare the provision of high, low, and ambiguous quality-of-evidence indicators against providing no such cues. Results show an asymmetric relationship: people react more strongly to cues of low quality of evidence than they do to high quality of evidence compared to no cue. While responses to a cue of high quality of evidence are not significantly different from no cue; a cue of low or uncertain quality of evidence is accompanied by lower perceived trustworthiness and lower use of the information in decision making. Cues of uncertain quality of evidence have a similar effect to those of low quality. These effects do not change with the addition of a reason for the indicated quality level. Our findings shed light on the effects of the communication of scientific uncertainty on judgment and decision making, and provide insights for evidence-based communications and informed decision making for policy makers and the public.},

  abstract = {Comparison of different lines of research on statistical intuitions and probabilistic reasoning reveals several puzzling contradictions. Whereas babies seem to be intuitive statisticians, surprisingly capable of statistical learning and inference, adults' statistical inferences have been found to be inconsistent with the rules of prob\- ability theory and statistics. Whereas researchers in the 1960s concluded that people's probability updating is ``conservatively'' proportional to normative predictions, probability updating research in the 1970s suggested that people are incapable of following Bayes's rule. And whereas animals appear to be strikingly risk savvy, humans often seem ``irrational'' when dealing with probabilistic information. Drawing on research on the description\textendash experience gap in risky choice, we integrate and systematize these findings from disparate fields of inquiry that have, to date, operated largely in parallel. Our synthesis shows that a key factor in understanding inconsistencies in statistical intuitions research is whether probabilistic inferences are based on symbolic, ab\- stract descriptions or on the direct experience of statistical information. We delineate this view from other conceptual accounts, consider potential mechanisms by which attributes of first-hand experience can facilitate appropriate statistical inference, and identify conditions under which they improve or impair probabilistic reasoning. To capture the full scope of human statistical intuition, we conclude, research on probabilistic reasoning across the lifespan, across species, and across research traditions must bear in mind that experience and symbolic description of the world may engage systematically distinct cognitive processes.},

In particular, the CRT is thought to measure monitoring of System 1 intuitions such that, if cognitive reflection is high enough, intuitive errors will be detected and the problem will be solved. However, CRT items also require numeric ability to be answered correctly and it is unclear how much numeric ability vs. cognitive reflection contributes to better decision making. In two studies, CRT responses were used to calculate Cognitive Reflection and numeric ability; a numeracy scale was also administered. Numeric ability, measured on the CRT or the numeracy scale, accounted for the CRT's ability to predict more normative decisions (a subscale of decision-making competence, incentivized measures of impatient and risk-averse choice, and self-reported financial outcomes); Cognitive Reflection contributed no independent predictive power. Results were similar whether the two abilities were modeled (Study 1) or calculated using proportions (Studies 1 and 2). These findings demonstrate numeric ability as a robust predictor of superior decision making across multiple tasks and outcomes. They also indicate that correlations of decision performance with the CRT are insufficient evidence to implicate overriding intuitions in the decision-making biases and outcomes we examined. Numeric ability appears to be the key mechanism instead.},

Design-Prospective study of consecutively recruited patients with cancer and other groups by questionnaire; half of the patients received the questionnaire again three months after starting treatment. Setting-A medical oncology ward of a London teaching hospital. Subjects- 106 Patients with newly diagnosed solid tumours referred to the unit for consideration of treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, 100 ofwhom were able to complete the questionnaire. 100 Matched controls, 315 cancer doctors (238 radiotherapists and 77 medical oncologists), 1500 randomly chosen general practitioners, and 1000 randomly chosen cancer nurses. Main outcome measures-Percentage chance of cure, prolonging life, or palliation of symptoms required to make treatment worth while with two hypothetical chemotherapy treatments, with severe and mild side effects respectively. Results-Respondents to the questionnaire comprised 100 patients, 100 controls, 60 (78\%) medical oncologists, 88 (37\%) radiotherapists, 790 (53\%) general practitioners, and 303 (30\%) cancer nurses. Most patients were willing to -accept intensive chemotherapy for a very small chance of benefit. The median benefit required to make the hypothetical intensive treatments worth while for patients compared with controls were: for chance of a cure (range 1 to 100\%) 1\% v 50\%, for prolonging life (range three months to five years) 12 months v 24-60 months, and for relief of symptoms (range 1 to 100\%) 10\% v 75\% respectively. There were no significant differences in the responses of the 50 patients completing the questionnaire on a second occasion. Doctors and nurses were less likely to accept radical treatment for minimal benefit compared with the patients (median scores 10-50\%, 12-24 months, and 50-75\%, for chance of cure, prolonging life, and relief of symptoms respectively). Significantly more patients than controls accepted treatments giving the minimal benefit for each category (cure 53-1 v 19'0\%, 67-0 v 35 0\%; prolonging life 42-1 v 10-0\%, 53 0 v 25 0\%; relief of symptoms 42-6 v 10-0\%, 58 7 v 19.0\% for intensive and mild treatments respectively, p{$<$}0-001) as was the case for comparison of patients with other groups. Conclusion-Patients with cancer are much more likely to opt for radical treatment with minimal chance of benefit than people who do not have cancer, including medical and nursing professionals.

This study aimed to prioritize and compare preferences of patients and doctors towards surgery for oesophagogastric cancer, to aid the counselling process. Methods: A discrete-choice questionnaire containing hypothetical scenarios was designed to test patient preferences for six treatment attributes: mortality, morbidity, quality of life (QoL), cure rate, hospital type and surgeon's reputation. The survey was mailed to all patients who underwent oesophagogastric cancer resection from 2008 to 2009 at two teaching hospital sites. All doctors at these sites with previous experience in counselling patients for cancer surgery were also identified and presented with the survey. Results were analysed using a random-effects probit regression model. Spearman correlation was used to compare participants' implicit choices from the discrete-choice scenarios (their true preferences) with their explicit choices from the direct ranking of preferences (their perceived preferences). Results: Eighty-one patients and 90 doctors completed the survey. Some 15 per cent of patients and 31 per cent of doctors based their choices solely on QoL. In order of importance, patients based their implicit responses on QoL ({$\beta$} = 1{$\cdot$}19), cure rate ({$\beta$} = 0{$\cdot$}82), morbidity ({$\beta$} = -0{$\cdot$}70), surgeon's reputation ({$\beta$} = 0{$\cdot$}60), mortality ({$\beta$} = -0{$\cdot$}57) and hospital type ({$\beta$} = 0{$\cdot$}26). Doctors similarly indicated QoL ({$\beta$} = 1{$\cdot$}14) and hospital type ({$\beta$} = 0{$\cdot$}31) as highest and lowest preferences respectively, but placed far greater emphasis on mortality ({$\beta$} = -0{$\cdot$}80) than morbidity ({$\beta$} = -0{$\cdot$}35). Implicit and explicit preferences correlated only for morbidity and surgeon's reputation in the patient cohort. Conclusion: Clinicians may better meet patients' expectations and facilitate informed decision-making if QoL, cure rate and morbidity are emphasized foremost. A similar study employing preoperative patients is warranted for further clarification of preferences.},

For instance, based on the result of the previous study, the number of deaths due to cancer was presented as: `2,414 out of 10,000', `1,286 out of 10,000', `24.14 out of 100' and `12.86 out of 100'. The estimates of deaths were presented in analogous ways for the remaining ten causes of death. It was hypothesized that the judged degree of riskiness is affected by the number of deaths, irrespective of the total possible number (such as 10,000 or 100). Results from Experiment 1 were consistent with this prediction. Participants rated cancer as riskier when it was described as `kills 1,286 out of 10,000 people' than as `kills 24.14 out of 100 people', and similar results were observed regarding the remaining 10 causes of death. Experiment 2 replicated this trend. Implications for risk communications are discussed. \& 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
